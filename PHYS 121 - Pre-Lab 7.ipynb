    "You are likely aware of the idea that the Earth has north and south magnetic poles. However, these names are a bit misleading. For one thing, since Earth's geographic north attracts the north pole of a bar magnet, Earth's *geographic* north pole is  a *magnetic* south pole.  This situation is depicted in **Fig. 1**.\n",

    "Further, these poles don't exactly coincide with the geological poles, and in fact the north pole is wandering NNW at about 55km per year. To confuse matters even more, by taking note of how flows of ferromagnetic magma have solidified in the past, we know that the Earth's magnetic field undergos occasional **geomagnetic reversals**, in which the magnetic poles effectively swap places.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from all these complications, the magnetic field of the Earth is stable enough for us to use it for navigation. In a compass, a magnetized needle on a low-friction bearing will swivel to align itself with the local magnetic field. This tells us what *direction* the horizontal component of the local field is pointing in, but what of the *magnitude*? Where you stand, how strong is the Earth's magnetic field?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this pre-lab, you will use simple vector analysis to see how it's possible to measure the local magnetic field using only a compass, a coil of wire, and a DC power source. This will equip you with the analytic tools to carry out the actual experiment in this week's lab.  \n",

    "## Creating uniform magnetic fields...\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique that we'll use to probe the magnetic field of the Earth requires use to generate a a uniform magnetic field and control its strength.  Before considering how we can produce a uniform magnetic field, let's first recall that capacitors can be used to produce uniform electric fields.  The left-had side of **Fig. 2** shows the electric field produced by a charged parallel-plate capacitor.\n",

    " - The electric field is strong between the plates and relatively weak everywhere else\n",
    " - The electric field between the plates is approximately uniform, especially in the region near the centre of the capacitor\n",
    " \n",
    "It is common to approximate the electric field of a capacitor as shown onm the right-hand side of **Fig. 2**.  In this approximation, the electric field between the plates is uniform with a magnitude given by $E=\\sigma/\\varepsilon_0$, where $\\sigma$ is the charge per unit area on the plates of the capacitor.  The electric field everywhere else is taken to be zero.  This approximation is very good when the plates are large compared the gap between the two plates. \n",
    " \n",
    "Whereas charge is a source of electric fields, we will see in class that *current* (or charge in motion) is a source of magnetic fields.  We can generate a uniform magnetic field using a coil of wire carrying a constant current $I$.  The left-hand side of **Fig. 3** shows the magnetic field created by a cylindrical coil supplied with a constant current.  These coils are often called **solenoids** or **inductors**.  \n",

In this approximation, the magnetic field in the bore of the solenoid is uniform and its zero outside the bore.  After studying Ampère's law, we'll be able to show that the magnitude of the uniform magnetic field in the bore is given by:\n",

    " - $N$ is the number of windings or loops of wire used to form the solenoid and $\\ell$ is the length of the solenoid\n",
